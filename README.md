# HR-DASHBOARD
Greetings to all.
Using #powerbi, I produced a multipage, interactive "HR DASHBOARD." 
This assignment taught me a lot, including how to use the "DAX and Power query editor." and developed new metrics for more insightful analysis.

The following conclusions can be taken from the dashboard:
1. The total number of employees (both male and female).
2. Promotions that are due or not.
3. The number of employees who are currently on the job and the number who need to be laid off.
4. The proximity of employees to their homes.
5. The number of job levels in the firm.
6. Job satisfaction among employees
7. Employee evaluation of the business.
